  Description:
    Abstract:
      The data contained in these files are hydrographic and topographic data collected by the SHOALS-1000T system 
      along the Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina and Virginia coastline as part of the National
      Coastal Mapping Program. 
      The lidar data for DE, MD, NJ and VA was collected from 20050824-20050908.
      The lidar data for NY and NC was collected from 20051001-20051126. 

      This data set is a raster file of z values with 3164 columns and 3162 rows. The data set was generated from a larger data set and includes all valid points within the requested geographic bounds.
      
    Purpose:
      These data were collected as a part of the National Coastal Mapping Program to depict the elevations above
      and below water for the Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina and Virginia coastal zones.

        This is an xyz dataset collected and provided by CESAM-OP-J, JALBTCX.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        FOR DE,MD,NJ,VA DATA:
        These data were collected using a SHOALS-1000T system. It is owned and operated by Fugro Pelagos performing 
        contract survey services for the US Army Corps of Engineers. The system collects topographic lidar data at 10kHz and
        hydrographic data at 1kHz.  The system also collects RGB imagery at 1Hz. Aircraft position, velocity and acceleration
        information are	collected through a combination of Novatel and POS A/V equipment.	Raw data are collected and transferred
        to the office for downloading and processing in SHOALS GCS software.	The data were collected and processed in geographic 
        coordinates and ellipsoid heights.  The positions are provided relative to NAD83 in decimal degrees of longitude and latitude.
        The heights were converted from ellipsoid to geoid heights (NAVD88) using NGS' Geoid03 model file "g2003u08.bin" with the
        results in meters. GPS data are processed using POSPac software and the results are combined with the lidar data to produce
        3-D positions for each lidar shot.   These data are edited using Fledermaus software where anomalous data are removed from 
        the dataset. The edited data are unloaded from SHOALS GCS, converted from ellipsoid to orthometric heights, based on the 
        GEOID03 model, and split into geographic tiles covering approximately 5km each.  The process date for this data set is 
        20060406, which is listed below as the process date for this process step.  

        FOR NY,NC DATA:
        Acquisition
        Data were acquired using a SHOALS-1000T.  Sensor orientation was measured using a POS AV 410, while images were acquired at 1Hz
        using a Duncantech DT4000 digital camera.  Prior to survey, PDOP was checked and missions planned to avoid PDOP greater than 3.5. 
        During survey, the plane was always within 30km of a GPS ground control point, to provide a good quality position solution.
        Final positions were determined using a post-processed inertially aided Kinematic GPS (KGPS) solution.  GPS ground control
        data were acquired at 1Hz.

        Data received by the airborne system were continually monitored for data quality during acquisition operations.   
        Display windows showed coverage and information about the system status.  In addition, center waveforms at 5Hz were shown.
        All of this information allowed the airborne operator to assess the quality of data being collected. 

        Data were processed in the field to verify coverage and data quality. Data were processed using the SHOALS Ground Control
        System (GCS). The GCS includes links to Applanix POSPac software for GPS and inertial processing, and IVS Fledermaus
        software for data visualization, 3D editing  and tie-line analysis.  Data were processed in NAD83 horizontal and vertical 
        datum.  Data were later converted to the NAVD88 vertical datum using the GEOID03 model. Fugro in-house utilities were used
        to extract XYZ data from  the native LIDAR files and split the data in to pre-defined  boxes, each covering approximately 
        5km of shoreline.   ASCII files include Longitude Latitude Elevation Date Time Intensity (Topo) or Depth Confidence (Hydro).
        The process date for this data set is 20060422.

      Process_Date: 20060406

    Process_Step:	
      Process_Description:
        The NOAA Coastal Services Center (CSC) received files in ascii format. The files contained lidar intensity and elevation
        measurements. CSC performed the following processing on the data to make it available within the Lidar Data Retrieval 
        Tool (LDART):
        1. Each hydro/topo last return ascii file was converted to las files.  Default values for which there is no corresponding
           input were assigned as follows for each las elevation data record: intensity = 0, retn = 1, nret = 1, class = 0
        2. The las files were sorted by latitude and the las header fields were updated.
        3. The data were converted to ellipsoid.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        The vertical values in this data set have been converted to reference NAVD88, using the GEOID12A grids provided by the National Geodetic Survey.   
      Process_Date: 20130710
    
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        The data values in this data set have been rasterized and stored in a 32-bit Floating point GeoTIFF format.  An ESRI style TIFF world file (.tfw) has been included with the coordinate location information, though it lacks the projection information. Cells with no data are contain an IEEE NaN value. 
      Process_Date: 20130710
    
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        The cell values in this data set represent the average elevation measurement found within each cell, or if there were no values in the cell, a value may have been interpolated from surrounding cells with data values.  The perimeter cells of a 3x3 box surrounding the empty cell is queried for known values - if less than three values are found, then the perimeter cells of a 5x5 box is searched for known values.  This process is repeated for a 7x7 box if less than 3 values are found.  If less than three accumulated known values were found, then the cell is assigned a no data value (usually -999999 for formats that have a tag for the nodata value, otherwise an IEEE NaN value). If at least 3 values were found in that search, the value in the empty cell is interpolated from the known values using an Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) method.
