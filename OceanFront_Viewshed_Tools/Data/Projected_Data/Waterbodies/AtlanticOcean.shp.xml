			<abstract>NOTE:

This metadata file contains information for Waterbody features delineated for NJ from 2002 color infrared (CIR) imagery with attributes extracted from the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) .

Digitizing of this data was initally done by Aerial Information Systems, Inc., Redlands, CA, under direction of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), Bureau of Geographic Information System (BGIS).

Conflation of USGS 1:24,000 High resolution NHD attributes was done by Data Enhancement Services, LLC  (DES) partenered with Civil Solutions.  This statewide conflation of NHD High resolution information was completed in 2010.
All QA/QC was done by NJDEP, Bureau of GIS and USGS.
This represents a subset of the statewide extract for NJ dated August 25, 2010.


Note:  This shapefile was generated from a SDE feature class layer.  Some attribute names over 10 characters were truncated during this process.  This metadata file has been modified to accommodate truncated field names.
</abstract>
			<purpose>
The data set will provide Waterbody  information for regulators, planners, and others interested in hydrography data.

The use of the NHD data layers in hydrologic analyses will provide a means of monitoring "the health of the citizens and ecosystems of New Jersey" through the use of diverse applications.

This data set is intended to serve as a resource for analysis rather than regulatory delineations. The NJDEP may change the line work based on more in depth analysis and field inspection for regulatory purposes.

NJDEP/BGIS is a stewardship partner with USGS in the development of Local resolution data which is NHD compliant.
</purpose>
			<supplinf>
Users of this data are strongly urged to become familiar with the USGS National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) review documents, as well as others included below, before using the data set.

NJDEP checked for delineation accuracy, connectivity, digitized "flow" direction, invalid attribute codes and corrected as identified.  Empty fields will be populated in future updates.

Feature types, characteristics, and other attributes conform to the Standards for National Hydrography Dataset (USGS, 1999) as of the date they were loaded into the database.  All names were validated against a current extract from the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS).  The entry and identifier for the names match those in the GNIS.

GNIS_Name is official only if identified by a GNIS_ID.   Any Flowline without a GNIS_ID but displays a GNIS_Name or "tributary" identifier is not official and is for NJDEP referencing purposes only.  These are subject to change when submissions are made to the Board of Geographic Names.
</attraccr>

		<logic>Lines conform to topological rules. Lines intersect only at nodes, and all nodes anchor the ends of lines.  Lines do not overshoot or undershoot other lines where they are supposed to meet.  There are no duplicate lines.  Lines bound areas and lines identify the areas to the left and right of the lines.</logic>

Data is available statewide for New Jersey.

This data represents a subset of the August 28, 2010  statewide extract of NHD High Resolution dataset after NJ completed a conflation of NHD attributes to local resolution features.

In general, all polygonal water features were reselected from NHDWaterbody and NHDArea feature classes and combined to create this data layer.

This data is considered Local resolution (1:2400) or better and conforms to all USGS NHD rules. ReachCodes have been defined on all features. Names were applied from the GNIS database during the final upload into the NHD.

Photo interpretation of 2002 CIR digital imagery, interactive editing and initial QA/QC was done by Aerial Information Systems, Redlands, CA.  Final QA/QC and final data formatting was done by NJDEP/BGIS.  All Data sets were processed and delivered by Hydrologic Unit 8 (HU8 - Subbasin) and this coding was maintained in the final versions.  The first version was released as Streams_2002.

This update to Streams_2002 data now includes NHD compliant attributes and coding.  NJDEP/BGIS completed a statewide conflation in 2010 to meet the USGS National Hydrography Dataset standards.  The conflation of 1:24,000 NHD high resolution feature attributes to this data was done by Data Enhancement Services, LLC under the direction of Civil Solutions beginning in 2009.   Initial QA/QC was done by NJDEP/BGIS followed by a review by USGS prior to upload into the National database.

QA/QC involved verifying that Flow Direction of each flowline is correct to facilitate the development of geometric networks.  Name Attributes are consistant with the USGS Geographic Names (GNIS) were transferred to this layer appropriately.  All unnamed tributaries flowing into a named water course stream have "tributary" extension in the GNIS_Name field.  GNIS_ID, GNIS_NAME, FTYPE, and FCODE attributes are NHD compliant and were transferred from the NHDgeo data layers.

Only features having a GNIS_ID are official. All other features represent local names subject to review.

This product is an interim product subject to attribute correction.
