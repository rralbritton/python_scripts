 #Name:         OceanFront_Viewshed.py
 #Purpose:      Calculates viewshed, in degrees, for all points within a point file
 #Author:       Rachel Albritton
# Last Updated: October 19, 2013

#Inputs:        This script takes NINE inputs. Each are described below
                #0 = Workspace. This is typically where the folder data is located
                #1 = Output workspace, the folder where you want the results saved.
                #2 = Observation points
                #3 = Building footprints
                #4 = Elevation
                #5 = BareElevation = Elevation that parcel sits at
                #6 = Ocean
                #7 = Floor Field - the feild located within the observation point file
                     #that contains the number f floors for each record
                #8 = Year the anaylsis is for

#Assumptions:   This tool assumes that all data inputs have been projected into a
                #coordinate system that has linear units. Angular units will provide
                #incorrect results, and may cause the script to fail completely.

                #This script also assumes that null values that may be present
                #within the elevation data have been converted to a value of 0.
                #The Raster_Fix.py script located within this tool box will
                #complete this task.
